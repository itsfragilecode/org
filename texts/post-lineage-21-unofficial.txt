[B]Testers needed![/B]

LineageOS is a free, community built, aftermarket firmware distribution of Android 14, which is designed to increase performance and reliability over stock Android for your device.

LineageOS is based on the Android Open Source Project with extra contributions from many people within the Android community. It can be used without any need to have any Google application installed. Linked below is a package that has come from another Android project that restore the Google parts. LineageOS does still include various hardware-specific code, which is also slowly being open-sourced anyway.

All the source code for LineageOS is available in the LineageOS Github repo. And if you would like to contribute to LineageOS, please visit out Gerrit Code Review. You can also view the Changelog for a full list of changes & features.

* before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if
* you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.

[B]Beware:[/B]
This is marked [I]unstable[/I] for a reason. It works well for me but I'm the only tester right now.

[B]Goals:[/B]
This ROM started as a personal build to get the latest Security Patch Levels integrated.
But as there are no current unofficial LineageOS build here I want to bridge this gap.

Wipe data & factory reset from LineageOS recovery.

Restart and enjoy.
